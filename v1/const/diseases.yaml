  name_th: ภาวะโลหิตจางจากเม็ดเลือดแดงแตกที่เกิดจากยา
  description: A type of acquired hemolytic anemia where certain medications trigger
    the destruction of red blood cells. This can occur through immune mechanisms (the
    drug causes the immune system to attack red cells) or non-immune mechanisms (direct
    oxidative damage to red cells, especially in G6PD deficiency). Symptoms are typical
    of anemia and hemolysis (fatigue, jaundice, dark urine). Stopping the offending
    drug is the primary treatment.

    (especially around the mouth and in hands/feet), chest pain, palpitations, and
    anxiety. HVS is often triggered by stress, anxiety, or panic, but can sometimes
    be related to underlying medical conditions. Management often involves breathing
    techniques and addressing underlying anxiety.

  name_th: ภาวะน้ำตาลในเลือดต่ำ
  description: A condition characterized by abnormally low blood glucose (sugar) levels,
    typically defined as below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). It most commonly occurs in people
    with diabetes as a side effect of diabetes medications (especially insulin or
    sulfonylureas), often due to too much medication, missed meals, or increased physical
    activity. Hypoglycemia can also occur in people without diabetes due to certain
    medications, critical illnesses, hormone deficiencies, or rare tumors (insulinoma).
    Symptoms include shakiness, sweating, palpitations, anxiety, hunger, confusion,
    blurred vision, seizures, or loss of consciousness if severe. Prompt treatment
    with fast-acting carbohydrates is needed.

  description: A condition in which the body's sex glands (gonads) — the testes in
    males and the ovaries in females — produce little or no sex hormones (testosterone
    or estrogen/progesterone). It can also involve deficient production of sperm or
    eggs. Hypogonadism can be primary (problem with the gonads themselves) or secondary/central
    (problem with the pituitary gland or hypothalamus in the brain that control the
    gonads). Causes include genetic disorders (e.g., Klinefelter syndrome, Turner
    syndrome), infection, tumors, radiation, autoimmune disease, or aging. Symptoms
    depend on age of onset but can include delayed puberty, infertility, fatigue,
    decreased libido, erectile dysfunction (males), menstrual irregularities (females),
    and loss of bone mass.

    instead of at the tip. The location of the opening can vary from just below the
    tip to the shaft, scrotum, or perineum. Hypospadias is often associated with chordee
    (a downward curvature of the penis) and sometimes an abnormal foreskin (dorsal
    hood). It is usually corrected surgically in infancy to allow for normal urination
    while standing and normal sexual function later in life.

  description: Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is elevated pressure inside the
    rigid skull, usually caused by an increase in the volume of brain tissue (swelling),
    cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or blood within the cranial cavity. Causes include
    head injury, stroke, tumors, hydrocephalus, or infections. If ICP becomes severely
    elevated and is not controlled, it can lead to brain herniation, where parts of
    the brain are squeezed or shifted from their normal position across structures
    within the skull (like the tentorium cerebelli or falx cerebri) or through the
    foramen magnum (opening at base of skull). Herniation compresses vital brain structures
    (like the brainstem), leading to neurological devastation, coma, and death. Specific
    herniation syndromes (e.g., uncal, central, tonsillar) produce characteristic
    clinical signs.

    the eye that covers the iris and pupil. Keratitis can be infectious (caused by
    bacteria, viruses like herpes simplex, fungi, or parasites like Acanthamoeba,
    often related to contact lens wear) or non-infectious (caused by injury, dry eye,
    autoimmune disorders, or UV light exposure - photokeratitis). Symptoms include
    eye pain, redness, blurred vision, light sensitivity (photophobia), excessive
    tearing, and sometimes discharge or a feeling of something in the eye. Prompt
    treatment is crucial to prevent corneal scarring and vision loss.

  name_th: ภาวะกล่องเสียงอ่อนยวบยาบ
  description: The most common congenital abnormality of the larynx (voice box) and
    the most frequent cause of stridor (noisy breathing) in infants. It involves softness
    and floppiness of the laryngeal tissues above the vocal cords (especially the
    epiglottis and arytenoid cartilages), causing them to collapse inward during inhalation,
    partially obstructing the airway. This results in a characteristic high-pitched
    inspiratory stridor, usually noticeable within the first few weeks of life, often
    worsening with feeding, crying, or lying flat. Most cases are mild and resolve
    spontaneously as the cartilage stiffens, typically by 18-24 months. Severe cases
    may cause feeding difficulties or respiratory distress requiring intervention.

    is produced from the normal breakdown of red blood cells. Newborns often develop
    mild jaundice (physiological jaundice) in the first few days of life because their
    immature liver cannot process bilirubin quickly enough; this usually resolves
    on its own. However, very high or rapidly rising bilirubin levels can be dangerous
    (pathological jaundice) and potentially cause brain damage (kernicterus). Causes
    of pathological jaundice include blood group incompatibilities (e.g., ABO, Rh),
    G6PD deficiency, infections, bruising from birth, or liver/biliary problems. Treatment
    often involves phototherapy (light therapy).

    Index (BMI), calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared
    (kg/m²). Generally, a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese, while a BMI of
    25-29.9 is considered overweight (thresholds may vary slightly by population).
    Obesity results from an energy imbalance (consuming more calories than expended)
    influenced by genetic, behavioral, metabolic, and environmental factors. It significantly
    increases the risk of numerous health problems, including type 2 diabetes, heart
    disease, stroke, high blood pressure, certain cancers, sleep apnea, and osteoarthritis.

  original_value: Obstructed labor
  disease_name: Obstructed labor
  name_th: การคลอดติดขัด
  description: Failure of labor to progress normally despite adequate uterine contractions,
    due to a physical blockage. This blockage usually arises from a mismatch between
    the size or position of the fetus and the size or shape of the maternal pelvis
    (cephalopelvic disproportion - CPD), or due to fetal malpresentation (e.g., transverse
    lie, breech) or malposition. Obstructed labor can lead to serious complications
    for both mother (e.g., uterine rupture, postpartum hemorrhage, infection, obstetric
    fistula) and baby (e.g., fetal distress, birth asphyxia, trauma, death). It often
    requires intervention, typically Cesarean section.

  description: Conditions affecting the urinary tract related to blockage or backflow
    of urine. Obstructive uropathy refers to structural or functional obstruction
    of normal urine flow anywhere along the urinary tract (from kidneys to urethra),
    which can lead to increased pressure upstream, potentially damaging the kidneys
    (hydronephrosis, kidney failure). Causes include kidney stones, tumors, enlarged
    prostate, strictures, or congenital anomalies. Reflux uropathy refers to kidney
    damage caused by vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), a condition where urine flows backward
    from the bladder up into the ureters and potentially the kidneys, often predisposing
    to kidney infections (pyelonephritis) and scarring.

  description: A common sleep disorder characterized by repeated episodes of complete
    or partial blockage (obstruction) of the upper airway during sleep, leading to
    pauses in breathing (apneas) or shallow breathing (hypopneas). These episodes
    cause intermittent drops in blood oxygen levels and brief awakenings (arousals)
    from sleep, disrupting sleep quality. The obstruction occurs when muscles in the
    back of the throat relax excessively. Symptoms include loud snoring (often with
    gasping or choking sounds), excessive daytime sleepiness, morning headaches, difficulty
    concentrating, and irritability. Risk factors include obesity, large neck circumference,
    anatomical factors narrowing the airway, and male gender. OSA is associated with
    increased risk of hypertension, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.

    types are related to potassium levels during attacks: hypokalemic periodic paralysis
    (low potassium), hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (high potassium), and normokalemic
    (normal potassium) or Andersen-Tawil syndrome (which also involves cardiac arrhythmias
    and dysmorphic features).'

    can include leg numbness or weakness, coldness in the lower leg or foot, non-healing
    sores on toes/feet/legs, changes in skin color, hair loss on legs, or weak pulse
    in legs/feet. Severe PAD can lead to critical limb ischemia (rest pain, ulcers,

    infections (about 70-95%) are asymptomatic or cause mild, flu-like illness (abortive
    polio). However, in a small percentage of cases, the virus invades the nervous
    system. Non-paralytic polio causes meningitis-like symptoms. Paralytic polio (less
    than 1% of infections) results in the virus damaging motor neurons, leading to
    acute flaccid paralysis (muscle weakness or paralysis), which can be permanent.
    If respiratory muscles are affected, it can be fatal. Polio is preventable through
    effective vaccination (IPV and OPV), and global eradication efforts have dramatically

  description: A fleshy, triangular or wing-shaped growth of degenerative conjunctival
    tissue that originates on the conjunctiva (white part of the eye) and grows onto
    the cornea (clear front part). Pterygia are benign (non-cancerous) and typically
    develop on the nasal side of the eye. They are strongly associated with chronic
    exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun, as well as exposure to wind,
    dust, and dryness. Small pterygia may cause only cosmetic concerns or mild irritation,
    but larger ones can cause redness, foreign body sensation, blurred vision (by
    inducing astigmatism or covering the pupil), and dryness. Surgical removal may
    be needed if symptoms are significant or vision is affected, although recurrence
    is common.

    postpartum. Common sites of infection include the uterus (endometritis - most
    common), perineal lacerations or episiotomy site, Cesarean section wound, or urinary
    tract. Symptoms often include fever (puerperal fever), lower abdominal pain, foul-smelling
    vaginal discharge (lochia), uterine tenderness, or wound infection signs. Risk
    factors include prolonged labor, prolonged rupture of membranes, C-section, and
    frequent vaginal examinations. Prompt antibiotic treatment is necessary to prevent
    complications like sepsis or pelvic abscess.

    breathing. Pulmonary edema can be cardiogenic (caused by heart problems, typically
    left-sided heart failure, leading to increased pressure in pulmonary capillaries
    forcing fluid out) or non-cardiogenic (caused by direct lung injury or increased
    capillary permeability, e.g., from ARDS, pneumonia, toxins, high altitude). Symptoms
    include extreme shortness of breath (dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal
    dyspnea), anxiety, feeling of suffocation, cough (often with frothy, pink sputum),
    wheezing, and rapid heartbeat. It is often a medical emergency requiring treatment
    directed at the underlying cause, oxygen therapy, and medications (like diuretics).

    body, typically the deep veins of the legs (deep vein thrombosis - DVT). Less
    commonly, emboli can be fat, air, tumor cells, or amniotic fluid. PE can be life-threatening
    as it obstructs blood flow through the lungs, straining the heart and impairing
    oxygenation. Symptoms often include sudden onset shortness of breath, sharp chest
    pain (worse with breathing), rapid heart rate, cough (sometimes with blood), dizziness,
    or fainting. Risk factors include DVT, recent surgery, immobility, cancer, pregnancy,
    and certain clotting disorders. Treatment involves anticoagulants or sometimes
    thrombolytics or procedures to remove the clot.

    typically transmitted through the saliva of an infected animal via a bite or scratch.
    Dogs are the main source of human rabies deaths globally, but other animals like
    bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes can also transmit it. Initial symptoms are often
    non-specific (fever, headache, malaise), followed by neurological symptoms as
    the virus spreads to the brain. These can include anxiety, confusion, agitation,
    delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, hydrophobia (fear of water due to
    throat spasms), and insomnia, eventually leading to paralysis, coma, and death,
    usually within days of symptom onset. Rabies is almost invariably fatal once symptoms
    appear, but it is preventable through prompt post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) involving
    wound washing, rabies vaccination, and administration of rabies immunoglobulin
    after exposure.

    violent crime with profound immediate and long-term physical and psychological
    consequences for the survivor. Medical care after assault is crucial, including
    treatment of injuries, testing and prevention for sexually transmitted infections
    (STIs) and pregnancy, and forensic evidence collection. Psychological support

  disease_name: Renal artery stenosis
  name_th: ภาวะหลอดเลือดแดงไตตีบ
  description: Narrowing (stenosis) of one or both renal arteries, the blood vessels
    that supply blood to the kidneys. Reduced blood flow to the kidneys triggers the
    release of hormones (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation) that lead
    to high blood pressure (renovascular hypertension). RAS can also impair kidney
    function over time, potentially leading to chronic kidney disease or kidney failure.
    The most common cause in older adults is atherosclerosis (plaque buildup). In
    younger individuals, especially women, fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD - abnormal
    cell growth in artery walls) is a more frequent cause. Diagnosis often involves
    imaging studies (ultrasound, CT angiography, MRA). Treatment may include medications
    to control blood pressure and sometimes procedures like angioplasty/stenting or
    surgery to open the artery.

    (a base) from the urine, leading to a buildup of acid in the blood (metabolic
    acidosis) despite relatively normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR). There are
    several types based on the specific tubular defect: Type 1 (distal RTA - impaired
    acid excretion in distal tubule), Type 2 (proximal RTA - impaired bicarbonate
    reabsorption in proximal tubule), and Type 4 (hyperkalemic RTA - often related
    to aldosterone deficiency or resistance, impairing both acid and potassium excretion).
    Consequences can include growth failure in children, bone disease (rickets/osteomalacia),
    kidney stones (especially Type 1), and electrolyte abnormalities (like hypokalemia

    Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), primarily affecting preterm infants due to
    surfactant deficiency leading to alveolar collapse; Transient Tachypnea of the
    Newborn (TTN), caused by delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid; Meconium Aspiration
    Syndrome (MAS), occurring when a stressed fetus passes meconium (first stool)

    gas exchange, resulting in abnormalities in arterial blood gas levels. It is broadly
    classified into two types: Type 1 (Hypoxemic) respiratory failure, characterized
    by low arterial oxygen levels (PaO2 < 60 mmHg) with normal or low carbon dioxide
    levels (PaCO2), usually due to problems with oxygen diffusion or ventilation-perfusion
    (V/Q) mismatch (e.g., pneumonia, ARDS, pulmonary edema). Type 2 (Hypercapnic)
    respiratory failure is characterized by high arterial carbon dioxide levels (PaCO2
    > 45-50 mmHg), often with hypoxemia, typically due to inadequate alveolar ventilation
    (hypoventilation) caused by conditions like COPD, neuromuscular diseases, drug
    overdose, or chest wall abnormalities. (Note: Hyperventilation usually leads to
    low CO2/hypocapnia, not respiratory failure itself, unless it''s compensating

    affects multiple joints symmetrically, often starting in the small joints of the
    hands and feet. Over time, persistent inflammation can lead to erosion of cartilage
    and bone, causing joint damage, deformity, and functional disability. RA can also
    affect other parts of the body (systemic effects), causing fatigue, fever, weight
    loss, rheumatoid nodules, or inflammation of organs like the eyes, lungs, or blood
    vessels. Early diagnosis and treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs
    (DMARDs) are crucial to control inflammation and prevent long-term damage.

    in blood pressure deprives the pituitary gland (which enlarges during pregnancy
    and is thus more vulnerable) of oxygen, causing damage or necrosis (tissue death).
    This results in hypopituitarism, a deficiency in one or more hormones produced
    by the pituitary gland (e.g., growth hormone, TSH, ACTH, FSH/LH, prolactin). Symptoms
    develop gradually over months or years and can include difficulty breastfeeding
    (lack of prolactin), loss of menstrual periods (amenorrhea), fatigue, cold intolerance
    (hypothyroidism), loss of pubic/axillary hair, low blood pressure, and hypoglycemia.

  description: An obstetric emergency occurring during vaginal delivery when, after
    the fetal head has delivered, the baby's anterior shoulder gets stuck behind the
    mother's pubic bone, preventing delivery of the rest of the body. It is unpredictable
    and requires immediate recognition and specific obstetric maneuvers (e.g., McRoberts
    maneuver, suprapubic pressure, rotational maneuvers) to dislodge the shoulder
    and complete the delivery quickly. Delay can lead to fetal hypoxia (oxygen deprivation)
    and potential complications for the baby, such as brachial plexus injury (nerve
    damage affecting the arm) or fractures (clavicle, humerus). Maternal complications
    can include postpartum hemorrhage and severe perineal tears.

    in the midline of the neck, usually below the hyoid bone. The cyst characteristically
    moves upward when the tongue is protruded or during swallowing. While usually
    benign, these cysts can become infected, forming an abscess, or rarely contain
    thyroid cancer. Treatment involves surgical excision of the cyst and the entire
    duct tract up to the base of the tongue (Sistrunk procedure) to prevent recurrence.

  name_th: ภาวะต่อมไทรอยด์เป็นพิษวิกฤต
  description: A rare, life-threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism (overactive
    thyroid gland), characterized by severe and exaggerated symptoms of thyrotoxicosis.
    It is a medical emergency triggered by stressors (like infection, surgery, trauma,
    or stopping antithyroid medication) in a patient with underlying hyperthyroidism
    (often Graves' disease). Symptoms include very high fever, rapid heart rate (tachycardia,
    often atrial fibrillation), high blood pressure (initially), agitation, delirium
    or psychosis, profuse sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, and potentially progressing
    to heart failure, shock, coma, and death if not treated promptly and aggressively.
    Management involves blocking thyroid hormone synthesis and release, controlling
    peripheral effects (e.g., with beta-blockers), supportive care, and treating the
    underlying precipitating cause.

    is an autoimmune disease and the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient
    areas. Subacute thyroiditis (de Quervain's) is likely viral or post-viral, causing
    transient hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism and neck pain. Postpartum
    thyroiditis is an autoimmune inflammation occurring after childbirth, also typically
    causing transient hyper- and hypothyroidism. Acute (suppurative) thyroiditis is
    a rare bacterial infection causing severe neck pain and fever. Silent (painless)
    thyroiditis is similar to postpartum thyroiditis but not related to pregnancy.
    Drug-induced thyroiditis (e.g., from amiodarone, lithium) can also occur.

    blood flow, and injury to the organs supplied by the affected vessels. Vasculitis
    can affect small, medium, or large vessels and range from localized to systemic
    disease. Examples include Kawasaki disease (medium vessels, children), Polyarteritis
    Nodosa (PAN, medium vessels), Giant Cell Arteritis (large vessels), ANCA-associated
    vasculitides (small vessels), and vasculitis induced by drugs or infections.

  description: Two conditions causing nasal inflammation and symptoms. Allergic rhinitis
    is an IgE-mediated response to allergens like pollen or dust mites, causing itching,
    sneezing, runny nose, and congestion. Vasomotor rhinitis (a type of nonallergic
    rhinitis) involves similar symptoms but is not allergy-driven; it's often triggered
    by environmental factors like temperature changes, irritants (smoke, perfume),
    or stress, likely due to nerve dysregulation affecting nasal blood vessels.

  name_th: พฤติกรรมรุนแรง
  description: Aggressive or violent behavior that can manifest during certain acute
    conditions. Acute psychosis (associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,
    etc.) or delirium (acute confusion state, often medical) can sometimes lead to
    agitation and aggression due to altered perceptions or fear. While violence is
    not typical of most mental illnesses, these acute states can increase risk and
    require careful management focused on safety and treating the underlying cause.

  description: Harmful effects from excessive intake of vitamins, usually via supplements.
    Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) pose a higher risk as they accumulate in the
    body. Examples include Hypervitaminosis A (liver damage, bone pain, birth defects)
    and Hypervitaminosis D (hypercalcemia, kidney problems). Water-soluble vitamins
    (B, C) are less likely to cause severe toxicity but can have side effects at very
    high doses.
